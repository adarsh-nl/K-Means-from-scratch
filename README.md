# K-Means-from-scratch
Implementation of K Means with out using sklearn.

This is a Python implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm. The main function takes in two inputs: "data", which is an array of data points, and "data_mean", which is the mean of the data points. It first prompts the user to enter the number of clusters (K), and then uses the initial_centroids function to randomly select K centroids from the data points. The Kmeans function is then used to assign each data point to one of the K clusters based on its distance to the centroids. The compute_centroid function is used to compute the new centroid for each cluster, and the process of assigning data points to clusters and computing new centroids is repeated until the cluster assignments no longer change. The compute_SSE_between and compute_SSE_total functions are then used to compute the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) between and total for the clusters. The script also uses a helper function called "debug" to print out intermediate results for debugging.
